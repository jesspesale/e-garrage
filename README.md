# Recipe Safe
Recipe Safe is Sinatra (and Ruby) web application that helps people keep track of and sotre their favorite recipes online.
<br>
As someone who is new to cooking (and baking), I am constantly looking up new recipes to either learn to make something new or help improve other recipes I have tried. With that being said, it has all been trial and error. I am starting to learn what I do and don't like to add to certain recipes. So Recipe Safe is the perfect place to store my favorites!
<br>
A user can create an account and keep track of recipes by their name, ingredients, instructions and cook time. They can always add new recipes and edit or delete existing recipes.
